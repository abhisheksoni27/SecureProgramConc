This requires that practitioners have a clear understanding of the foundational concepts in secure programming to serve as a basis for building new knowledge and responding to new challenges. The Secure Programming Concept Inventory is designed to measure an individual's understanding of secure programming concepts.

            <h2>What is a Concept Inventory?</h2>
            A concept inventory is an assessment tool designed to measure an individual's understanding of concepts in a specific knowledge domain. Concept inventories have two advantages over most standard tests: they are easy to administer and score, and they probe beyond recognition or memorization to examine a student's understanding of a concept
            <br /><br /><br />
            <h2>How did we create the Secure Programming Concept Inventory?</h2>
            The inventory was based on the foundational, knowledge critical concepts in the domain of secure programming. These are described in the <a href='#/dashboard/ConceptMap'>Concept Map</a>. Hard topics and common misconceptions held by students were identified using interviews with students and instructors. A pool of items that specifically target difficult concepts and misconceptions was developed. The pool of items was tested and refined to develop a validated secure programming concept inventory.
